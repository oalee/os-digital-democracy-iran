## Open Science Research - Enhancing Democracy For The People of Iran Through Social Digital Innovation

This repository hosts the research materials for the Open Science Research project, focusing on enhancing digital democracy in Iran. The project aims to study and propose socially-driven digital innovations that can improve democratic processes for Iranian citizens, with consideration for both immediate application and future deployment.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the research phase. We are currently looking for collaborators to help us with the research and development of the project. If you are interested in contributing, please see the [Contribution](#contribution) section below and introduce yourself in the discussions.

### Upcoming Research

Current three approaches have been identified to advance digital democracy in Iran (though I haven't fully explained them in the paper yet):

* Open-sourcing democratic work, such as the Mahsa Charter, to enhance transparency and openly showcase revisions and collaboration processes.
* ADFIran can systematically address public concerns by analyzing public opinion on social media platforms like Twitter, examining rational discussions (e.g., well-reasoned content from users like Kardo, DaiKatu, or GaldriedMahsa's critiques), and featuring FAQs and responses on their website. This can be further improved with a systematic question-answering and discussion platform.
* Developing an open-source, open-science, democratic collaborative writing platform that systematically engages the public through Q&A and discussions. This wiki-like platform enables users to access the latest updates on articles, plans, and research, raise questions, and participate in rational discussions around the content. Articles should be presented in increasing complexity levels for accessibility, including children. The platform should facilitate open Q&A sessions and rational discussions among users. Technically this can be viewed as a merge of wiki interface with GitHub, with links to questions, and discussions with pol.is for analyzing public opinion and letting people participate in discussions about research/content.
